# Expense-Tracker
📌 Project Description

This Expense Tracker is a beginner-friendly Python project built to practice fundamental programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, user input handling, and conditional logic. The application runs in a command-line interface and allows users to add expenses, view all recorded entries, and calculate total spending.

Each expense is stored as a dictionary inside a list, demonstrating how simple data structures can be used to organize and manage real-world information. The program uses a clear, menu-driven flow that guides the user through all available actions, reinforcing control structures and basic input/output operations.

Though simple in functionality, this project represents the foundation of my Python learning journey. It reflects the process of turning basic concepts into a practical tool and marks an early step toward building more advanced and structured applications.
